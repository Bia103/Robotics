**Name of the project:** Matrix game

**Hardware:** 1 8x8 LED matrix,1 MAX7219 Driver, 1 LCD, 1 joystick, 1 buzzer, wires, arduino, connector cable.

**Description:** The game approaches the idea of a solider(the player) which stands in the middle of the matrix and has a shield. The solider will be attacked with magical orbs(dots) from multiple directions and he will have to use the shield to defend himself. Also, he can get bonuses(that will add up to the score) that are coming from his allies in the form of blinking dots. There multiple levels in which the magical orbs will come faster to him making it a challange to defend himself. Also the player will have 3 lives, and if he dies, the game will be over.

**How to play:** You have a joystick and depending on the position you move it, the shield will change its place, there are 4 position in which the shield will stay, up, down, left, right . You have to use the shield to defend yourself agains the dots that are coming to you from all of the 4 directions and you should not use it to defend yourself against the blinking ones, because the blinking ones are bonuses and will increase your score.

The LCD will display a start button, and a highscore one.
