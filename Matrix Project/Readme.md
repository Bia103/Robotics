**Name of the project:** Matrix game

**Hardware:** 1 8x8 LED matrix,1 MAX7219 Driver, 1 LCD, 1 joystick, 1 buzzer, wires, arduino, connector cable.

**Description:** The game approaches the idea of a solider(the player) which stands in the middle of the matrix and has a shield. The solider will be attacked with magical spells(dots) from multiple directions and he will have to use the shield to defend himself. Also, he can get bonuses(that will add up to the score) that are coming from his allies in the form of blinking dots, but if he shields himself from them, he will lose a life. There will be more levels(3) in which the magical spells will come faster to him making it a challange to defend himself. Also the player will have 3 lives, and if he dies, the game will be over.

The LCD will display a start button, and a highscore one.
